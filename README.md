## üéØ Context & State Management

This project uses **React Context API** for global state management of expenses, wallet balance, and ID tracking. The `ExpenseProvider` component handles business logic and data persistence using `localStorage`.

### üîÑ Persisted State

- `expenses`: List of all expenses (stored in `localStorage`)
- `walletBalance`: User's current wallet amount (stored in `localStorage`)
- `nextId`: Auto-incrementing ID for unique expense entries (stored in `localStorage`)
- `freedIds`: Recycled IDs from deleted expenses (stored in `localStorage`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Context Features

| Function           | Description                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addExpense`       | Adds a new expense after checking wallet balance and assigns a unique ID |
| `deleteExpense`    | Removes expense, refunds amount to wallet, and recycles ID               |
| `editExpense`      | Updates expense and recalculates wallet balance with validation          |
| `addWalletBalance` | Adds income to wallet balance                                            |
| `totalExpense`     | Computed value representing total of all expenses                        |
| `walletBalance`    | Computed value representing wallet balance                               |

All updates are automatically synced to `localStorage` via `useEffect`.
